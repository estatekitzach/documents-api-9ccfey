# Technical Specifications

# 1. INTRODUCTION

## 1.1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The EstateKit Documents API is a secure document management system designed to provide document storage, analysis, and lifecycle management capabilities for the EstateKit application ecosystem. This system addresses the critical need for secure document handling in estate management by providing encrypted storage in AWS S3, automated document analysis through AWS Textract, and comprehensive document lifecycle management. Primary stakeholders include EstateKit applications and integrated web services requiring secure document processing capabilities. The system will deliver significant value through automated document analysis, secure storage, and regulatory compliance, enabling efficient estate document management at scale.

No user interface required. This is a backend API service that provides document management capabilities through REST endpoints only. All interactions are handled programmatically through API calls. For frontend interface requirements, please refer to the consuming applications' specifications.

Note: The EstateKit Documents API is designed as a headless service focused on document processing, storage, and analysis functionality. User interface components are implemented by the consuming EstateKit applications and web services that integrate with this API.
